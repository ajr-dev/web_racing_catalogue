## Project Overview

BERTIE RABIE RACING LOFT was a web-based platform developed to catalogue racing pigeons in a town where pigeon racing is a popular sport and hobby. The project aimed to digitize and streamline the process of tracking and managing racing pigeon information.

## Status: Abandoned

**⚠️ This project was abandoned in February 2024 after a month of development.**

The project is no longer maintained due to a preference for traditional tracking methods among the target users.

## Features

- Comprehensive pigeon database search functionality
- Detailed pigeon profiles including:
  - Complete family tree information
  - Performance history
- PDF export feature for offline use, including:
  - QR code linking back to the web version of the pigeon profile
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and data retrieval

### Planned Features (Not Implemented)

- User authentication system
- Personal pigeon cataloguing for registered users
- Community-driven database expansion

## Why This Project?

The BERTIE RABIE RACING LOFT platform was conceived to:

- Modernize pigeon racing record-keeping
- Provide easy access to comprehensive pigeon information
- Facilitate information sharing among racing enthusiasts
- Streamline the process of presenting pigeon data at meetings
- Create a community-driven, diverse database of racing pigeons

## Technologies

The project was built using the following technology stack (or planned):

- Frontend and Backend: SvelteKit (full-stack framework), Tailwind
- Database: MongoDB for flexible, document-based data storage
- Hosting/Deployment: Vercel for seamless deployment and hosting
- Build System: Turborepo for optimized build processes and monorepo management

This stack was chosen for its performance, scalability, and developer-friendly ecosystem, allowing for rapid development and efficient data management.
